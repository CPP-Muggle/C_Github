Similar to Exercise A, I made 3 functions global:

PerpetualPut:Perpetual Put option pricing

PerpetualCall:Perpetual Call option pricing

MeshArray:creat Meshed Array

And I created a class PAmerican Option which contains constructor/deconstructor 
and necessary class member functions:

PerPutOption: Calculate Perpetual Put Option given different stock price

PerCallOption: Calculate Perpetual Call Option given different stock price
